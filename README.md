## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to simulate and demonstrate how quantum computing can be used to crack passwords more efficiently than classical methods. The project uses **Grover's algorithm**, a quantum search algorithm that can search an unsorted database of \(N\) entries in \(O(\sqrt{N})\) time, compared to \(O(N)\) for classical algorithms.

The project includes:
- A **quantum circuit simulation** using Qiskit.
- Support for running the quantum circuit on **IBM Quantum hardware**.
- Research materials on quantum computing frameworks, algorithms, and their applications.

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project:

### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.8 or higher.
2. `pip` (Python package manager).

### Recommended
- Use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:
  ```bash
  python -m venv env
  source env/bin/activate
  ```

### Steps
1. Install Qiskit:
   ```bash
   pip install qiskit
   ```
2. Install Qiskit IBM Quantum Provider:
   ```bash
   pip install qiskit-ibm-provider
   ```
3. Set up your IBM Quantum account:
   - Sign up at [IBM Quantum Experience](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/).
   - Get your API token from the IBM Quantum dashboard.
4. Save your IBM Quantum API token:
   ```bash
   echo 'YOUR_API_TOKEN' > ~/.qiskit/token
   ```

## Usage
### Running the Demo Simulation
1. Navigate to the `demo` folder:
   ```bash
   cd demo
   ```
2. Run the demo quantum circuit:
   ```bash
   python demo_circuit.py
   ```
   This script demonstrates the creation of a superposition and entanglement in a simple quantum circuit.

### Running on IBM Quantum Hardware
1. Navigate to the `demo` folder:
   ```bash
   cd demo
   ```
2. Run the script to execute the quantum circuit on IBM Quantum hardware:
   ```bash
   python run_on_ibm.py
   ```
   Note: Quantum backends may be busy; choose an available backend from [IBM Quantum](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/).
